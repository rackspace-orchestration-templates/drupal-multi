Recipes
-------
### default
Installs the varnish package, manages the default varnish configuration file, and the init script defaults file.

### repo
If placed before the default recipe in the run list, the official Varnish project apt repository will offer access to more version and platform support.

Usage
-----
On systems that need a high performance caching server, use `recipe[varnish]`. Additional configuration can be done by modifying the `default.vcl.erb` and `default.erb` templates.

If running on a Redhat derivative then you may need to include yum-epel as it provides the jemalloc dependency that varnish needs
