  Drupal is an open-source web application framework that allows to PHP
  developers to easily create dynamic websites.
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Drupal, check out [Getting started with Drupal 7
  administration](https://drupal.org/getting-started/7/admin) or [Getting
  started with Drupal 6
  administration](https://drupal.org/getting-started/6/admin). The getting
  started document will help guide you through the initial steps of checking
  your site's status, customizing your site's informaion, adding users, and
  more!

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.

  A system user called 'drupal' has been created as a part of this deployment.
  There is no password associated with this account. You will need to set a
  password for this user if you'd like to use the account for transferring
  content, backups, or other purposes. Since the account has no password, no
  one will be able to login as this user until a password is set.

  Drupal was installed using [Drush](http://drush.ws/about). Drupal is
  installed into /var/www/drupal and served by
  [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/). The Apache configuration is in
  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/drupal.conf. Any changes to the configuration
  would require a restart of Apache.

  [Lsyncd](https://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/) has been in installed to sync
  static content across the front end servers. All new content will be
  published to the master node and then synced across with lsync to the other
  web nodes. When uploading content while migrating a site, you'll only need to
  upload the content to the master node. The configuration for lsync can be
  found in /etc/lsyncd.

  [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is the database backend used in this
  deployment. The MySQL root password is included in the password section of
  this deployment. If you do lose the password, it is also available in
  /root/.my.cnf on the database server itself. MySQL backups are performed
  locally by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/). The backups will be
  stored in /var/lib/mysqlbackup on the database server.

  #### Updating Drupal
  Drupal does provide community documentation on [how to
  upgrade](https://drupal.org/upgrade) your installation of Drupal. There are
  several steps involved with the upgrade process. First, make sure to backup
  your site files and your database prior to taking any steps to replace the
  core site files. There are number of other tutorials available on places like
  YouTube that can also step you though the upgrade/update process. There is
  not currently a way to perform these upgrades automatically through the admin
  interface. Since you have selected the multi-server option, you will only
  need to upgrade the master node, and lsync will take care of syncing
  everything to the other web nodes.

  #### Migrating an Existing Site
  Moving a Drupal site can be both difficult and time consuming. Drupal Modules
  such as the [Backup and Migrate
  module](http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) can help you move your
  database content. We recommend backing everything up on both the source and
  destination locations before anything is done. The content you want to move
  over will be in the 'sites' directory. If you're running a single Drupal
  site, you may just need the content of 'sites/default/files' along with your
  database. Be careful not to overwrite the settings.php file within your site.
  It contains the database configuration for your site.

  This deployment has all of the core drupal files in place, and their
  permissions are properly set. Be careful with ownership and permissions as
  you move things over. If you're unsure, check the original ownership and
  permissions of the files in this deployment.

  #### Additional Modules
  There are over 22,000 modules that have been created by an enaged developer
  community. The [modules](https://drupal.org/project/Modules) section on
  Drupal's website provides an easy way to search for and research modules.

  #### Scaling out
  This single server deployment is not well suited to be scaled out.  We
  recommend leveraging a multi server option. If content needs to be moved,
  instructions above regarding migrating an existing site may help with that
  transition.

  Multiple Linux servers with [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) installed with
  [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) and
  [Lsyncd](https://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/) balanced with a Cloud
  Load Balancer. The database server will be deployed with
  [MySQL 5.5](http://www.mysql.com/). This deployment is intended for
  development and production use cases incurring medium to high traffic
  scenarios. It is highly scalable and is appropriate for high traffic events.
